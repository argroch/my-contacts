# This file should contain all the record creation needed to seed the database with its default values.
# The data can then be loaded with the rake db:seed (or created alongside the db with db:setup).
#
# Examples:
#
#   cities = City.create([{ name: 'Chicago' }, { name: 'Copenhagen' }])
#   Mayor.create(name: 'Emanuel', city: cities.first)

# 5.times do
# 	contact = Contact.create(
#     first_name: Faker::Name.first_name,
#     last_name: Faker::Name.last_name,
#     email: Faker::Internet.email,
#     address: Faker::Address.street_address,
#     city: Faker::Address.city,
#     state: Faker::Address.state_abbr,
#     zip: Faker::Address.zip,
#     phone1: Faker::PhoneNumber.phone_number,
#     phone2: Faker::PhoneNumber.phone_number,
#     latitude: Faker::Address.latitude.to_f,
#     longitude: Faker::Address.longitude.to_f
#   )
